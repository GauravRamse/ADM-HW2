We have performed data analysis on data Oct-2019 and Nov-2019, downloaded from the https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store?select=2019-Oct.csv
Whe decide to performe our analisys with Dask library. We choose Dask becouse it can enable efficient parallel computing on a single machines by leveraging their multi-core CPUs and streaming data efficiently from disk, preventing us to load the entire dataset on RAM. We olso convert our data in Apache Parquet file in order to save memory.

/*
#### Why we have use Dask
* Dask helps to load huge amount of data in RAM (like lazy loading).
* Eneable parallel computing on a single machine



#### Folder structure
      We have created main.ipynb file where you can find code to solve research question
